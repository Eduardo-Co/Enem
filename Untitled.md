## *How to Prove Polish Citizenship and Apply for a Polish Passport*

To be eligible for a Polish passport, you must first *confirm your Polish citizenship*.

### Step 1: Check Your Eligibility

The first step is to determine whether you have inherited the *right to Polish citizenship. This is based on the **principle of jus sanguinis* (right of blood), meaning citizenship is passed down through your Polish ancestors — regardless of where you were born.

A quick conversation with family members may reveal whether you're likely eligible. If so, the next step is documentation.

### Step 2: Collect Polish Ancestral Documents

To confirm eligibility, you’ll need *Polish documents* from your ancestors, such as:

* Polish passports
* Military service records
* Identity cards
* Proof of residence
* Voting lists

If you don’t have these documents, it’s still possible to locate them by working with professional researchers who access *Polish national archives* and local registry offices. Despite the impact of the wars, many historical documents have been well-preserved.

### Step 3: Submit a Legal Citizenship Confirmation

Once eligibility is verified and the documentation is in hand, you can begin the official *citizenship confirmation process* through legal representatives or citizenship service offices in Poland. The process typically takes around *five months*, though it may vary by case.

### Step 4: Apply for a Polish Passport

After receiving confirmation of your citizenship, you can visit a *Polish consulate or embassy* to apply for your Polish passport. For many, this is more than just a travel document — it’s a gateway to *a better life in Europe*.

## 🧬 *Citizenship Is More Than a Legal Process — It's a Personal Journey*

> “*Citizenship is a side effect — a consequence — of your desire to connect with your ancestors.*
>
> Think about it: if you don’t even know your great-grandparents’ names, let alone where they lived, what they were like, or what their dreams were, then you too will be forgotten within a few generations.
>
> Even if you rely on professionals for help, *genealogical research must involve your active participation*.
>
> Genealogy is a time machine. It brings you back to your roots, helping you understand where you came from.
>
> But it also projects you into the future — by combining the love you give to your children with your legacy, you ensure your name and your story will live on, passed down through generations.”
