[18/07/2025 12:36] Vinicius Teles: *Polish Citizenship by Marriage: Is It Possible?*

Poland has one of the largest diasporas in the world, with significant Polish communities in countries such as the United States, Germany, Canada, Australia, Israel, and many others. It is not uncommon for Polish citizens to marry foreign nationals in these countries. But does marrying a Polish citizen grant you Polish citizenship?

To answer that, it's important to understand that Polish citizenship law is based on the principle of ius sanguinis (right of blood), meaning citizenship is passed down through descent rather than place of birth. This means that being born outside of Poland has no bearing on one’s eligibility for Polish citizenship, provided there is a proven connection to a Polish citizen. Moreover, there is no generational limit on the inheritance of citizenship rights.

### Polish Citizenship by Marriage

The key legislation governing Polish citizenship is the Act of January 31, 1920, which has been amended by subsequent laws in 1951, 1962, and 2011. These legal frameworks help define the conditions under which citizenship can be acquired through marriage.

Article 4 of the 1920 Act states that Polish citizenship can be obtained by birth, adoption, public service, military service, grant, recognition, and marriage.

Article 7 specifically notes that foreign women could acquire Polish citizenship by marrying Polish citizens. However, later legal amendments introduced important conditions and restrictions that make the process more complex — and, in some cases, not feasible.

For instance, Article 9 clarifies that citizenship cannot be granted by marriage to individuals who have been convicted in Polish courts of crimes that result in the loss of civil rights, or to individuals who are insolvent.

### Is Marrying a Polish Citizen Enough?

No. In practice, marriage to a Polish citizen does not automatically grant citizenship. It may allow the foreign spouse to obtain a temporary residence permit in Poland, which does authorize them to work in the country.

A permanent residence permit can only be granted after the foreign spouse has lived in Poland on a temporary residence permit (based on the marriage) for at least two years, and the couple has been married for a minimum of three years.

Only after obtaining permanent residency and living in Poland for at least two more years can the foreign spouse apply for Polish citizenship through naturalization. The naturalization process typically takes another two years, although this may vary case by case.

### Alternatives: Citizenship by Descent

As noted earlier, Polish citizenship is rooted in the principle of descent. This means that individuals with Polish ancestors — regardless of their country of birth — may be eligible for citizenship.

Historical context matters here: until January 19, 1951, children born within a legally recognized marriage inherited Polish citizenship only from their father. Children born out of wedlock or without a recognized father could inherit citizenship from their mother.

Because many Polish citizens emigrated during the 20th century, millions of people around the world may be eligible for Polish citizenship today. To qualify, three main requirements must be met:

* You must prove that your ancestor was a Polish citizen;
* You must prove your familial link to that ancestor;
* You must prove that citizenship was not lost along the way.

### Dual Citizenship

Another option to consider is dual citizenship. Many countries — including the United States, Canada, Australia, Israel, and others — allow dual nationality, which can make the process easier for Polish descendants or spouses of Polish citizens.

However, Polish law requires that anyone who holds Polish citizenship is considered exclusively a Polish citizen by Polish authorities, regardless of any other nationalities they may have.

Having a Polish passport means enjoying the same rights as any other citizen of a European Union country — including the right to live, work, and study anywhere in the EU. There is no mandatory military service in Poland. However, taxes may apply if a citizen earns income or conducts business in Poland while not residing there permanently.

### Visa Requirements

Those planning to stay in Poland for less than 90 days for purposes such as tourism, business, visiting family, or attending unpaid conferences may not require a visa — depending on their country of citizenship. However, this visa exemption does *not* apply to those intending to study, work, or apply for citizenship. In such cases, a visa is required.

For up-to-date visa information and specific entry requirements, it is best to contact the Polish embassy or consulate in your country.

Have you researched your family history and discovered that you're of Polish descent? If so, you've probably heard about the possibility of *dual citizenship. Are you interested in **applying for Polish citizenship* but unsure how to do it properly? You’re in the right place!

Understanding how the *Polish citizenship process* works is not always simple or quick. It requires having the right documents and following the correct legal steps to obtain your *Polish passport* and claim your *European citizenship*.

Don't give up just because the process seems bureaucratic or time-consuming. This article is here to help you. Keep reading to learn the *step-by-step guide to getting Polish citizenship* and the documents you’ll need.

---

## *Why You Should Apply for Polish Citizenship*

Holding *Polish citizenship* means *unrestricted access to all EU countries*. Imagine traveling, studying, or working across Europe without worrying about visas and paperwork. You’ll only go through the bureaucracy once — after that, you’re free to move, work, and live across the European Union.

And it's not just for you. Your children and future generations will also benefit from *Polish dual citizenship*, enjoying the same rights and opportunities.

However, before enjoying these benefits, it’s crucial to understand how the process of *obtaining Polish citizenship by descent* works — especially if you don’t speak Polish or aren’t familiar with Polish legal procedures. That’s why working with a *specialized citizenship agency in Poland* can make all the difference.

---

## *7 Steps to Obtain Polish Citizenship by Descent*

### 1. *Check and Confirm Your Eligibility for Polish Citizenship*

The first step is confirming your *eligibility. Polish citizenship is based on the **"right of blood" (jus sanguinis). That means if one of your parents or ancestors was a Polish citizen, you may also be legally entitled to **Polish citizenship by descent*, regardless of where you were born or currently live.

To qualify, you must prove:

* Your ancestor was a Polish citizen;
* You are directly descended from them;
* They did not lose their Polish citizenship over time.

This step is essential. Without proven eligibility, no further steps matter.

---

### 2. *Gather the Required Polish Documents*

Once your eligibility is confirmed, the next step is documentation. You must provide *official Polish documents* proving your ancestor’s citizenship.

Key documents may include:

* Polish passports;
* Polish national ID cards;
* Proofs of residency in Poland;
* Voter registration records;
* Military records.

All documents must have been issued by *Polish authorities after 1920*. If your application lacks official Polish documentation, it will not be processed.

---

### 3. *Search Polish Archives for Missing Documents*

What if you don’t have the necessary Polish documents? Don’t worry — it’s still possible.

You’ll need to *hire a professional researcher* to search in *Polish state and regional archives*. These experts know where and how to find official records such as birth, marriage, and military documents that are essential to your case.

Using a qualified researcher will *save time and money* by finding only the documents that truly matter.

---

### 4. *Appoint a Legal Representative in Poland*

Since the Polish law change in 2009, anyone applying for citizenship from outside Poland must appoint a *legal representative (procurator)* based in Poland.

Although your application can be submitted through a Polish consulate, *any additional steps must be handled by your legal representative within Poland*. Without one, your case may stall or be rejected.

---

### 5. *Understand Dual Citizenship Laws in Poland*

Polish law states that anyone with *Polish dual citizenship* is considered *only Polish* by Polish authorities — regardless of any other passport they hold.

This means that if you obtain *Polish nationality, you will enjoy the **full rights of a European Union citizen*, such as:

* Working and living freely in any EU country;
* Access to healthcare and education across Europe;
* Simplified travel and visa processes.

Most countries with large Polish diaspora communities — like the *United States, Canada, Brazil, and Israel* — allow dual citizenship. So you won't have to renounce your current nationality.

---

### 6. *Get Your European Union Passport*

Once you’ve obtained your Polish citizenship, you’ll be eligible to apply for a *Polish passport* — which is also an *EU passport*.

This powerful document allows you to:

* Travel across the EU without a visa;
* Live and work in countries like Germany, France, the Netherlands, and more;
* Give your family the same benefits for generations to come.

---

### 7. *See the Process as an Investment*

Finally, remember that the entire process is an *investment in your future*. Costs may include:

* Archive research in Poland;
* Certified translations;
* Passport fees;
* Legal representation.

But the *long-term value of EU citizenship* — for travel, career, education, and family — far outweighs the cost.

The *timeframe for Polish citizenship approval* varies depending on your case, but with proper documentation, it can move faster than you think.

Have you ever thought about living in the European Union? Wondering if it’s possible and what steps you need to take to make it happen? You're not alone. Many people who dream of moving to Europe have similar doubts. The truth is, there are several important steps and legal requirements involved in making that dream a reality.

One of the first (and most powerful) paths is *obtaining dual citizenship. Do you know if you might be eligible for **Polish citizenship by descent*? And if so, do you know how to apply? The process involves several documents and legal steps, so it’s essential to understand each part carefully.

Even if you’re not eligible for citizenship, there are still ways to *live legally in the EU, although they tend to be time-limited. In this article, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know — from dual citizenship and permanent residency to the documents required to **move to Poland or another EU country*.

---

## *Polish Citizenship: The Key to Living Freely in the EU*

Before diving into the types of residency options, it's important to understand that *not everyone can move to the European Union legally* on a permanent basis. For long-term stays or full rights, you must *inherit or acquire citizenship* through your ancestry — unless you’re applying for a temporary visa.

In the case of *Polish citizenship, the law is based on the principle of *jus sanguinis (right of blood). This means that if you have Polish ancestors, especially those who emigrated from Poland in the 19th or 20th centuries, you may be entitled to *dual citizenship* — even if you didn’t know it.

A significant number of people around the world, especially in countries with large Polish diaspora populations, qualify for *Polish citizenship by descent. You might be one of them! That’s why we always recommend starting with an **eligibility check*.

---

## *How to Apply for Polish Citizenship by Descent*

If your eligibility is confirmed, you can begin the *Polish citizenship application process*. To do this, you’ll need official documents proving your Polish ancestry. These may include:

* Polish passport
* National ID card
* Military booklet
* Residency records
* Voter registration or other civil documents

If you don’t have these documents, don’t worry — you can hire a *professional researcher in Poland* to search the national and regional archives for you. Once documents are secured, you’ll need a *legal representative in Poland* to handle the case, especially since the law requires that applicants living abroad appoint a local attorney.

After the application is submitted, you’ll need to wait for the authorities to evaluate your case individually. If successful, you’ll receive your *certificate of Polish citizenship* — the final step before applying for your *European passport*.

---

## *How to Legally Stay in the European Union*

Whether you’re applying for *citizenship or just a temporary stay, here are the main types of **residency permits in Poland* (and most EU countries):

### 1. *Temporary Residence Permit*

This permit allows you to stay in Poland for 1 to 3 years. If you apply for 1 year and want to extend it, you must apply for a renewal before the first permit expires. It's one of the most common ways to *live legally in the EU* for non-citizens.

### 2. *EU Blue Card*

Designed for highly skilled professionals, the *Blue Card* grants residence for up to 2 years. To qualify, you need:

* A valid employment contract of at least 1 year
* A monthly salary above 6,407.27 PLN (approx. \$1,890 USD or €1,530)

This is ideal for individuals seeking to *work in Poland or elsewhere in the EU* with better legal benefits and mobility.

### 3. *Permanent Residence Permit*

This is the most important for those planning to live in Poland long term. You can apply for *permanent residency* after:

* 3+ years of residence on a marriage-based temporary permit, or
* 5+ years of continuous legal residence without family ties

If you apply based on marriage to a Polish citizen, you’ll need:

* Four recent passport-size photos (45x35mm, white background)
* Two copies of your passport (including all visa and stamp pages)
* Two completed application forms (in Polish)
* Polish marriage certificate issued within the last 3 months
* ID of your Polish spouse

Original documents must be presented along with the copies for verification.

---

## *Documents You’ll Need to Live in Poland Legally*

Besides your residence permit, here are other essential documents required to *live and work in Poland legally*:

### 1. *Driver’s License*

If you already have a valid license, you can use an *International Driving Permit (IDP)* for up to 6 months. After that, you must *exchange it for a Polish driver’s license (Prawo Jazdy)*.

### 2. *Work Permit*

To be employed legally in Poland, a *work permit (zezwolenie na pracę)* is required unless you have citizenship or permanent residency. Typically, the employer submits the application on your behalf.

### 3. *PESEL Number (National Identification)*

The *PESEL* is an 11-digit ID number used to register residents and citizens in Poland. It is required for:

* Opening a bank account
* Buying or renting property
* Accessing public healthcare
* Signing contracts and more

It’s the Polish equivalent of a Social Security Number or National ID in other countries.

---

## *Take the First Step: Check Your Eligibility for Polish Citizenship*

Now that you know it’s possible to *move to the European Union legally, especially through Polish ancestry, don’t wait to get started. Even though there are temporary options for living in Europe, **having citizenship gives you long-term freedom and full rights*.

✅ Take our *free eligibility test* today to find out if you qualify for *Polish dual citizenship*.
This is the first (and most important) step toward your future in Europe.

[18/07/2025 12:36] Vinicius Teles: # *What Is Polish Citizenship and Who Is Eligible?*

Did you know that Poland has one of the largest diasporas in the world — with significant populations in the United States, Germany, and beyond? This global spread is largely due to the wave of emigration from Poland between 1841 and 1971, a period when millions left in search of better opportunities.

Today, the trend has reversed: descendants of Polish emigrants around the world — including the Americas, Australia, and Europe — are now exploring their *right to Polish citizenship* as a pathway to reconnect with their heritage and access the benefits of *European Union citizenship*.

But who exactly is eligible for *Polish citizenship by descent*, and how does the process work? This article explains everything you need to know.

---

## *What Is Polish Citizenship?*

Polish citizenship is a legal status that gives an individual full rights under Polish law, including the right to live, work, study, and do business in Poland and across the European Union. For many, it also means *dual citizenship* — holding both their current nationality and Polish nationality simultaneously.

Polish citizenship law is based on the *principle of jus sanguinis* (right of blood), meaning that citizenship is inherited from one’s parents, regardless of the place of birth. There are *no generational limits*, so even great-grandchildren of Polish citizens may be eligible, provided certain legal criteria are met.

Each application is assessed individually and must follow strict legal guidelines. It is not possible to “buy” Polish citizenship or apply simply by interest — the applicant must *legally inherit the right*.

---

## *Who Is Eligible for Polish Citizenship?*

You may be eligible for Polish citizenship if you have Polish ancestors who emigrated from Poland *after 1920*.

Why 1920? Because although Poland regained its independence in 1918, it wasn’t until *1920* that its modern borders and citizenship laws were officially established. Before 1918, Poland was partitioned and controlled by Austria, Russia, and Prussia, and thus didn’t exist as a sovereign state — making citizenship claims more difficult to prove.

Polish emigrants who left the country after 1920 may have *retained their citizenship* if they registered with a Polish consulate abroad or voluntarily joined the Polish army. Their descendants could still legally inherit that status.

It’s also important to note that:

* *Before 1951, citizenship could only be passed down through the **father. Illegitimate children could inherit from the **mother*.
* From *1951 onward, individuals could only lose Polish citizenship **voluntarily*, through an official declaration before Polish authorities.
* Before 1951, citizenship could be lost by:

  * Acquiring another citizenship through naturalization or marriage (for women);
  * Holding a political or administrative position in a foreign government;
  * Serving in a foreign military.

---

## *Changes in Polish Citizenship Law Over Time*

Several laws have shaped Polish nationality rights:

* *1920 Citizenship Act*: The first post-independence law outlining who qualifies as a Polish citizen.
* *1962 Law*: Stated that citizenship is automatically granted at birth if at least one parent is a Polish citizen.
* *2009 Law (in effect since August 15, 2012): Introduced the possibility to **reinstate lost Polish citizenship* — but only for those who lost it *before January 1, 1999*, and only applies to minor children of the applicant.

Every case is *reviewed individually* by Polish authorities. Legal nuances, exceptions, and historical details are often involved — which is why many people choose to work with legal professionals or genealogical experts during the process.

---

## *How to Apply for Polish Citizenship*

If your ancestry and documentation indicate that you may be eligible, you can *start the Polish citizenship confirmation process*.

### Which Authority Handles the Process?

* If you’ve *lived in Poland, your application is reviewed by the **Wojewoda* (Provincial Governor) where you resided.
* If you’ve *never lived in Poland, your case is handled by the **Wojewoda Mazowiecki* (Provincial Governor of the Mazowieckie Region) based in *Warsaw*.

### What Do You Need?

You will need to gather personal documents and information about your Polish ancestors, such as:

* Birth, marriage, and death certificates;
* Polish passports or identity documents;
* Military service records;
* Evidence of residence or registration in Poland;
* Consular registrations.

*All documents must be verified, and in many cases, they must be submitted in **Polish*. If you don’t speak the language, you’ll likely need help from a certified translator or a specialized citizenship firm familiar with Polish legal procedures.

After reviewing your application and documents, the *Wojewoda* will issue a ruling. It’s important to note that this authority does not “grant” new citizenship — it simply *confirms whether or not you already hold Polish citizenship by descent*.

Your application will be *approved* if:

* Your documentation proves that you have legally inherited Polish citizenship and have not lost it.

It will be *denied* if:

* You never held Polish citizenship;
* Your ancestors lost it before it could be passed to you;
* Your documentation is insufficient to prove your claim.

---

## *What’s the Timeline for Polish Citizenship Confirmation?*

The timeline varies from case to case. If all documents are complete and your eligibility is clear, the process can be reasonably swift. However, complex cases or missing records may require additional time, particularly if archive research is needed.

---

## *Not Sure If You're Eligible? Take the Polish Citizenship Test*

If you’re unsure whether you qualify, the best way to start is by taking a *free eligibility test. It only takes a few minutes and can help you determine whether it’s worth pursuing a **Polish passport* — and with it, the rights of a full *European Union citizen*.

👉 Take the test now and take the first step toward reconnecting with your Polish roots — and securing a future in Europe.

A quick conversation with family members may reveal whether you're likely eligible. If so, the next step is documentation.

### Step 2: Collect Polish Ancestral Documents

To confirm eligibility, you’ll need *Polish documents* from your ancestors, such as:

* Polish passports
* Military service records
* Identity cards
* Proof of residence
* Voting lists

If you don’t have these documents, it’s still possible to locate them by working with professional researchers who access *Polish national archives* and local registry offices. Despite the impact of the wars, many historical documents have been well-preserved.

### Step 3: Submit a Legal Citizenship Confirmation

Once eligibility is verified and the documentation is in hand, you can begin the official *citizenship confirmation process* through legal representatives or citizenship service offices in Poland. The process typically takes around *five months*, though it may vary by case.

### Step 4: Apply for a Polish Passport

After receiving confirmation of your citizenship, you can visit a *Polish consulate or embassy* to apply for your Polish passport. For many, this is more than just a travel document — it’s a gateway to *a better life in Europe*.

While searching for insightful perspectives on citizenship and ancestry, we came across a thought-provoking message shared on Facebook — and it couldn’t be more relevant to anyone pursuing dual citizenship.

Regardless of the country, anyone interested in reclaiming their *ancestral citizenship* should take this message to heart. It’s a reminder that obtaining a passport is only one part of the journey. *Reconnecting with your family’s past* is the true foundation.

Below, we’ve translated and adapted the original post written by *Rodrigo Ruiz*, offering an inspiring reflection on identity, legacy, and personal responsibility.

> “*Citizenship is a side effect — a consequence — of your desire to connect with your ancestors.*
>
> Think about it: if you don’t even know your great-grandparents’ names, let alone where they lived, what they were like, or what their dreams were, then you too will be forgotten within a few generations.
>
> Even if you rely on professionals for help, *genealogical research must involve your active participation*.
>
> Genealogy is a time machine. It brings you back to your roots, helping you understand where you came from.

## ✨ *Genealogy Is the Foundation of Identity*

We often see people give up when they can't immediately find birth certificates or immigration records. But remember:

* Start with *family conversations*
